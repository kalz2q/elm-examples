# elm-projects
I am Learning Elm 0.19.

All the elm source files are available at https://github.com/kalz2q/elm-projects

Elm sources are in elm-src directory.

Html files are in src directory.
```
elm make elm-src/hogehoge.elm --output=src/hogehoge.html
```
You can link to html files through
[links to html](https://kalz2q.github.io/elm-projects/)
