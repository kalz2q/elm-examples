Learning Elm 0.19

according to my current premmature knowledge , 
```
elm make src/something.elm
```
makes index.html.

so, i change the name and place to something like , 
```
mv index.html src/something.html
```
and then
```
elm make src/Main.elm
```
this makes index.html which refer to something.html

this way I can make many elm and html files to show to others.

```
source fiels are
```
https://github.com/kalz2q/elm-projects
```
so, you can see the resultign html files or git clone everything and see by 
```
elm reactor
```
enjoy!
